---- Fedora configuration ----

It may be desirable--and in fact necessary for some modules--to disable/remove
one of the default XACML policies which denies any interactions with the
POLICY datastream to users without the "administrator" role.

This policy is located here:
$FEDORA_HOME/data/fedora-xacml-policies/repository-policies/default/deny-policy-management-if-not-administrator.xml

---- Solr searching hook ----

In order to comply with XACML restrictions placed on objects, a hook is used to filter results that do not conform to a searching user's roles and name.
This hook will not function correctly if the Solr fields for 'ViewableByUser' and 'ViewableByRole' are not defined correctly. These values can be set through
the admin page for the module.

---- Issues with autocomplete ----

There are two known issues that exist within Drupal's autocomplete that can be fixed by patching Drupal.

First issue is "."s appearing in the autocomplete field resulting in a 404 error (http://drupal.org/node/93854#comment-6164592).
Second issue is when pressing the down arrow and focusing on another field "undefined" appears in the textfield (http://drupal.org/node/172755).
