---- Fedora configuration ----

It may be desirable--and in fact necessary for some modules--to disable/remove
one of the default XACML policies which denies any interactions with the
POLICY datastream to users without the "administrator" role.

---- Issues with autocomplete ----

There are two known issues that exist within Drupal's autocomplete that can be fixed by patching Drupal.

First issue is "."s appearing in the autocomplete field resulting in a 404 error (http://drupal.org/node/93854#comment-6164592).
Second issue is when pressing the down arrow and focusing on another field "undefined" appears in the textfield (http://drupal.org/node/172755).
