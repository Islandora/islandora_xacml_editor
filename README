There are two known issues that exist within Drupal's autocomplete that can be fixed by patching Drupal.

First issue is "."s appearing in the autocomplete field resulting in a 404 error (http://drupal.org/node/93854#comment-6164592).

Second issue is when pressing the down arrow and focusing on another field "undefined" appears in the textfield (http://drupal.org/node/172755).
