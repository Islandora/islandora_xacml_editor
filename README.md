# Islandora XACML Editor [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/islandora_xacml_editor.png?branch=7.x)](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/islandora_xacml_editor)

## Introduction

The Islandora XACML Editor provides a graphical user interface to edit XACML policies for objects in a repository or collection. It adds a new tab to each collection called Child Policy and a tab to each item called Item Policy, where permissions can be set on a per User or per Role basis for:

* Object Management: Controls who can set XACML policies for an object/collection.
* Object Viewing: Controls who can view an object/collection.
* Datastreams and MIME types: Controls who can view datastreams by DSID and MIME type.

## Requirements

This module requires the following modules/libraries:

* [Islandora](https://github.com/islandora/islandora)
* [Tuque](https://github.com/islandora/tuque)
* [Islandora XACML API](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_xacml_editor/tree/7.x/api)

## Installation

Install as usual, see [this](https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7) for further information.

## Configuration

### Fedora Configuration

It may be desirable--and in fact necessary for some modules--to disable/remove one of the default XACML policies which denies any interactions with the POLICY datastream to users without the "administrator" role.

This policy is located here:
`$FEDORA_HOME/data/fedora-xacml-policies/repository-policies/default/deny-policy-management-if-not-administrator.xml`

### Solr Searching Hook

In order to comply with XACML restrictions placed on objects, a hook is used to filter results that do not conform to a searching user's roles and name. This hook will not function correctly if the Solr fields for `ViewableByUser` and `ViewableByRole` are not defined correctly as they are set in the XSLT. These values can be set through the admin page for the module.

### Drush 

#### Apply XACML policy to target object

To add policy.xml to object islandora:57:
`drush -v --user=1 islandora_xacml_editor_apply_policy --policy=/tmp/policy.xml --pid=islandora:57`

To apply this policy to islandora:57 and all child objects, add the `--traversal` option.

#### Force XACML inheritance to child objects

To apply the XACML policy from islandora:root to its children:
`drush -v --user=1 islandora_xacml_editor_force_policy_inheritance --pid=islandora:root`

To apply this policy only to immediate children, use the `--shallow_traversal` option. Disabled by default

The target object must have a POLICY datastream.

### Notes

The XACML editor hooks into ingesting through the interface. When a child is added through the interface, the parent's POLICY will be applied if one exists.

If XACML policies are written or edited by hand, it may result in unexpected behaviour.
